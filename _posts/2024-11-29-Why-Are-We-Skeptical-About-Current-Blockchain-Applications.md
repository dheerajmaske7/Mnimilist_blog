1/ **Premise**

Blockchain is a powerful technology with immense potential, but I often wonder: **“Is it solving the problems people face today?”**  
Coming from a developing country like India, where basic necessities are a priority for many, I question whether blockchain applications align with the issues that matter most in a direct way.

---

### 2/ The Real Problems People Face

For many in developing countries, the key challenges are:
- **Access to food and clean water**
- **Affordable healthcare**
- **Basic education**
- **Jobs and financial stability**

These are urgent and immediate needs. Blockchain doesn’t seem to directly address them.

---

### 3/ What Blockchain Projects Focus On

Current blockchain projects often target:
- **Decentralization and open protocols**
- **Addressing monopolistic control** (e.g., Google, Amazon)
- **Data transparency and censorship resistance**

However, most blockchain-based companies and projects today are heavily focused on building infrastructure for themselves and their communities rather than directly solving real-world problems that impact people’s lives.

---

### 3.1/ Why the Disconnection?

Blockchain projects often focus on foundational infrastructure, while big companies (e.g., Google, Amazon) have already established trust, practical applications, and solutions for immediate user needs.  

Blockchain’s potential applications may only become clear in **5–10 years**, once foundational work is complete. Until then, user-level applications are limited.

---

### 4/ A Customer’s Perspective

From a user’s point of view:
- **If the current system works (e.g., Google or Amazon), why should I switch?**
- **Switching costs are high**: Blockchain alternatives often require learning new systems or sacrificing convenience.
- **What’s the incentive?** If basic needs are already met, decentralization alone isn’t compelling enough.

---

### 5/ A Simple Example: Google Search vs Blockchain Search

- **Google** is fast, reliable, and convenient.  
- A blockchain-based alternative might offer decentralization, but if my needs are already met, I don’t care about the technology behind it.  
- Technology should **enable solutions**, not become the center of the problem-solving process.

Without a clear, immediate benefit, users are unlikely to switch.

---

### 6/ A Good Example: ChatGPT

Consider **ChatGPT**:
- It uses advanced technology (AI and machine learning) to solve current problems, like improving productivity, answering questions, and generating content.
- People adopted it because it provided **immediate value**.

ChatGPT shows how technology becomes meaningful when it solves real-world problems today, not just prepares for the future.

---

### 7/ Blockchain’s Long-Term Potential

Blockchain could address future problems like:
- **Transparent voting systems** or supply chains.
- **Censorship resistance** in oppressive regimes.
- **Better ownership models** for creators.

However, these solutions feel far removed from the pressing needs of people dealing with daily challenges like survival and stability.

---

### 8/ Building Blockchain Applications in India

For blockchain applications to succeed in India, they must focus on solving problems tied to **basic necessities**, such as:
- **Affordable healthcare**
- **Food distribution and transparency** in welfare programs
- **Improving education systems**

Solutions that directly impact people’s lives today while decentralizing systems will help build **trust and adoption**. Without this focus, blockchain applications may struggle to gain traction over the next 2–3 years, even if the technology itself is promising.

---

### 9/ Final Thoughts

I’m not skeptical about the power of blockchain technology — its potential is immense. But for it to be impactful, the applications must solve problems that people care about **today**, not just prepare for the future.

Blockchain must strive to:
1. Address real, urgent problems.
2. Make people’s lives better **now**, not decades later.
