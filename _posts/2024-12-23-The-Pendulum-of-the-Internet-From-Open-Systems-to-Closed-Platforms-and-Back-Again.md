The history of the internet can be described as a pendulum, swinging between two extremes: **open systems** where anyone can innovate, and **closed platforms** controlled by big companies like Google and Amazon.

### The Early Internet: A World of Open Systems

In the 1990s, open systems like websites using HTTP and email using SMTP prevailed. These technologies were not owned by any single company, enabling widespread creativity and innovation. Developers and entrepreneurs thrived in this environment, building freely without gatekeepers.

### The Rise of Closed Platforms

Fast forward to today, and the internet is largely dominated by big companies. Social media, messaging, and payment systems are controlled by a few platforms. This limits the opportunities for creators and developers, as these platforms dictate the rules.

### The Downfall of Closed Systems

History shows that closed systems eventually lose their edge. As they stagnate, people begin to turn back to **open systems** that promote creativity and freedom. The internet’s innovation has always been fueled by openness, and the pendulum is bound to swing back.

### The Future of the Internet: Decentralized and Open

The future belongs to builders, entrepreneurs, and developers who find new ways to bring **openness back to the internet**. Decentralized systems play a crucial role in this transformation.

### Why Decentralizers Matter

Decentralized systems return power to the people by removing gatekeepers. They ensure:
- **Innovation**: Open platforms allow anyone to create and innovate freely.
- **Fairness**: No single entity controls the system, reducing monopolistic behavior.
- **Freedom**: Users can build, connect, and thrive without limitations.

### Building the Next Era of the Internet

The pendulum will swing again, back to open systems. The future of the internet depends on those who:
1. Embrace decentralization.
2. Build systems that prioritize fairness and user empowerment.
3. Create platforms where everyone can participate without restrictions.

The internet’s future is open, innovative, and decentralized — and it’s up to us to build it.
